CommentPress Core
=================

*CommentPress Core* is an open source theme and plugin for WordPress that allows readers to comment paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line or block-by-block in the margins of a text.

Annotate, gloss, workshop, debate: with *CommentPress Core* you can do all of these things on a finer-grained level, turning a document into a conversation. It can be applied to a fixed document (paper/essay/book etc.) or to a running blog. Use it in combination with *BuddyPress* and *BuddyPress Groupblog* to create communities around your documents.

**The name has been changed from *CommentPress* to *CommentPress Core* for two reasons:** (a) because it serves as the basis for extending it for your purposes and (b) to safeguard historical installations, which could break if they upgrade. Newer *CommentPress* installations (versions 3.0.x - 3.3.x) can upgrade to the current version.

**Please note:** this plugin comes bundled with two official themes. The new *CommentPress Modern Theme* will be auto-activated when the plugin is first activated. The old *CommentPress Default Theme* is still included for those who wish to stay with it or have built their own child themes for it. If you are upgrading from a previous version of *CommentPress* (3.0.x - 3.3.x), please follow the instructions in the Installation section before doing so.

**For sites hosted in the European Union, please note:** the *CommentPress Default Theme* makes use of cookies, but for presentational purposes only. If you intend to use the *CommentPress Default Theme* on a public site, you may need to inform visitors of this.

For further information and instructions please see the [CommentPress site](http://www.futureofthebook.org/commentpress/) or contact the developers by email at [cpdev@futureofthebook.org](mailto:cpdev@futureofthebook.org)
